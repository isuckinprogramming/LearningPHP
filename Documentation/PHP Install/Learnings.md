# **My Learnings**

This process is very similar to learning java.
A different name, a different purpose, a somewhat similar path.

I honestly don't know what is happening as I was clicking something or that thing.

I don't have any idea about "thread-safe" which is somehow relevant to the 
zip file that I downloaded.

![I asked google about thread safe 1 of many results](./resources/thread-safe%20meaning%201.PNG)

![The second result I checked because the first one is just as confusing](./resources/thread-safe%20meaning%202.PNG)

I got php installed and the job is done????
Like why do I have to register php to the Path Variable?????

All of which, I have no plans to answer.
