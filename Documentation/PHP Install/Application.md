# **Following a tutorial to install PHP**

The process of installation is kind of simpler than I thought.

I was following the tutorial video about Php [from FreeCodeCamp by Mike Dane]([https://](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK_JCtrrv-c))

[W3schools]([https://](https://www.w3schools.com/php/)) is good and all.
W3schools is direct to the point and provide relevant examples with a
focus in simple and precise manner.

Which is exactly what I need when I need a quick Reference, however I find using the website as a primary or main material
difficult.

I wanted to ask some (some not all because who knows what kind of shit chat gpt will tell me to do) help from chatGPT but I decided against the idea, because the margin of error is critical when installing a program in your own personal computer or device.  
I mean if there is more room for experimentation and fuck-ups, I think Leaving everything to chat GPT will be fine but... I still want to use a stable computer sooo.... I just went straight to following the youtube video tutorial.

After asking chat gpt, I realized, fuck it I'll just follow the youtube tutorial.

I think the website for downloading the Php zip file is complicated.

There are just way too many terms I can't follow and don't understand, googling 
and searching for whatever what 'that' or 'this' do is kind of time consuming 
so I just followed the choice chosen according to the tutorial. 

This is why I prefer to follow video tutorials over w3schools online guides when I am still 
new to something, having no prior knowledge of a subject and relying text or visual materials alone 
is challenging, I find it difficult but I don't know about the general situation.


After I downloaded the file, following the instructions, I extracted the 
contents to the root directory folder.

After Extraction of the Zip file.

Then After this process is registering the path where I extracted php to the `Path` variable of the System.
This part is something I don't understand at all. Like why?????? 
Back in the lab I was able to execute php code just fine.
